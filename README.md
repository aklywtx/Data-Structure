# data-structure
The course is "数据结构"(Data Structure), a MOOC course from Zhejiang University in China. This course is of high quality and covers many data structures and algorithms, including Linear List, Stack, Heap, Queue, Tree(Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Balanced Binary Tree) and Graph.
The course is based on C and taught in Chinese. 
I took this course during the summer vacation in 2021 and have completed most homework with C++.
